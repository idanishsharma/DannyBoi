The uploaded file has code for my Object detection model that is based upon YOLO model and the dataset i used is Coco Dataset. It is able to detct any object from an image. After downloading the file the only change that you'll have to do is change the location for your dataset.
# I'll also upload the dataset if you wan me to. Just let me know if you want the dataset to play with the model.
